*Sorry, I don't written a **single word of code**!
so I didn't want to write an document because I will **stuck** in this document. :-(*
## Q&A
**Q1:** So when are you going to write a document?

A1: Maybe version 1 is done.

**Q2:** So Where I can see how to use it!

A2: See branch "doc" and you will see the "changelog.md" you should check this!

**Q3:** Does it works on MS-DOS 6.22?
A3: I using Windows ME & DOS version is 8.0.
But, 6.22 & FreeDOS & WinME's final version is too long.
Waiting for.
But you can try the build, have a bug, tell me!
